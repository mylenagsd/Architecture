NOTES:
considering the "report_timing_summary" and following the steps on the site you sent me, you can check there in "mytiming.rpt" that 
"The requirement was 10 ns, and the slack 7.259 ns, which means that we could have asked for a clock period 7.259 ns
shorter and it would still be OK. So it could have been 10 â€“ 7.259 = 2.741 ns, which is some 365 MHz."
the document is inside the folder of the project.

if you can't open the project like today, just copy the source "FSM_mult1" is the one I did with one process. and if you need that,
change the "simu_FSM" to be compatible with the new source.

there's a printscreem "simu_1process" showing it works.
