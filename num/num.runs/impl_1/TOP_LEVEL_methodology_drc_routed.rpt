LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell C1/a2/FSM_onehot_etatp[5]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) C1/a1/FSM_onehot_etatp_reg[1]/CLR, C1/a1/FSM_onehot_etatp_reg[2]/CLR, C1/a1/FSM_onehot_etatp_reg[3]/CLR, C1/a1/FSM_onehot_etatp_reg[4]/CLR, C1/a1/FSM_onehot_etatp_reg[5]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[0]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[10]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[11]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[12]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[13]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[14]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[15]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[16]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[17]/CLR, C1/a1/count_reg[18]/CLR (the first 15 of 42 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.358 ns between C2/X_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and C2/temp_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -10.665 ns between C2/X_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and C2/temp_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.018 ns between C2/X_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and C2/temp_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.078 ns between C2/X_reg[0]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and C2/temp_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin).
